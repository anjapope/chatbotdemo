# Introduction to Chatbots

## What is a Chatbot?

A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. Chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to understand user inputs and provide appropriate responses.

## Types of Chatbots

### Rule-Based Chatbots
- Follow predefined rules and decision trees
- Work well for specific, structured tasks
- Limited flexibility but predictable behavior

### AI-Powered Chatbots
- Use machine learning and NLP
- Can handle more complex conversations
- Learn and improve over time

### Hybrid Chatbots
- Combine rule-based and AI approaches
- Provide both structure and flexibility
- Most common in production systems

## Applications of Chatbots

Chatbots are used in various domains:

- **Customer Service**: Answering FAQs, handling support tickets
- **E-commerce**: Product recommendations, order tracking
- **Healthcare**: Appointment scheduling, symptom checking
- **Education**: Tutoring, answering student questions
- **Entertainment**: Interactive storytelling, games

## Key Components

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: Interpreting user intent
2. **Dialog Management**: Maintaining conversation context
3. **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: Creating responses
4. **Integration Layer**: Connecting to external systems
